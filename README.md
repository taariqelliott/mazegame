Welcome!!

My name is Taariq Elliott and this is a simple maze game!

At first I initially wanted to make a battle game, but it evolved into a game of avoid and seek the exit.

The user has to get to the "answer" by navigating the maze.
The user will used the "WASD" keys to move the character to the destination marked on the game board
The user will have to unlock a button in order to proceed to the next level and that is achieved by navigating to a certain spot on the game board

MVP Goals

1. As a user, I want the game to have multiple levels, so I feel like I'm making progress toward a destination.
2. As a user, I want the game to have colors, icons, and things moving so the game feels engaging.
3. As a user, I would like the game to be interactive so it doesn't feel so static
4. As a user, I want the game to have penalties so I'm forced to be careful and take my time with the functionality of the game.

Stretch Goals

1. As a user, I want the game to give me prompts so I know what to do and how this game functions
2. As a user, I want to feel accomplished at the end of the game by completing all the levels
3. As a user, I want the game to be timed so I can move with a sense of urgency.
